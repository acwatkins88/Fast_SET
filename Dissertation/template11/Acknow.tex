\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

I would first like to thank my advisor Dr.\ Spyros Tragoudas for his guidance and assistance throughout the writing of this dissertation. I can most assuredly say that throughout my time working with Dr. Tragoudas, that my writing and research skills have greatly improved. I feel that his support during my doctoral studies will be crucial to my future success. Next, I would like to also acknowledge Dr.\ Haibo Wang for his collaboration during this work. Many times when I would have a question regarding circuit theory or design, he would always be available to provide valuable insight.

Furthermore, I would like to show my appreciation to Dr.\ Chao Lu and Dr.\ Themistoklis Haniotakis for serving on my dissertation committee and providing valuable feedback. I also feel obliged to acknowledge Dr.\ Heather Quinn at Los Alamos National Laboratories for being my GRA mentor and dissertation committee member. Her input has allowed me to increase the breadth of my knowledge on soft errors and has allowed me to approach the many problems from a different angle. 

I am also grateful towards my parents Daniel and Debbie Burris who have supported me from the very beginning. They have always pushed me to work hard every day and have provided advisement for the many tough decisions throughout my life. Lastly, I would like to thank my wife Yijing Watkins for her patience during my doctoral studies. She has always been there for me and has provided encouragement for me to continue to work hard.
